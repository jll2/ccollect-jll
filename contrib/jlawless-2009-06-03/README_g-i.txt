Hello Nico,

     I have attached three more patches for ccollect.  Each patch
has comments explaining its motivation.

     All of these patches work-for-me (but I continue to test
them).  I would be interested in your opinion on, for example, the
general approach used in i.patch which changes the way options are
handled.  I think it is a big improvement.  If, however, you wanted
the code to go in a different direction, let me know before we
diverge too far.

Regards,

John
